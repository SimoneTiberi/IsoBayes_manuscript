PSM (PeptideHit) without protein reference found. This may indicate incomplete mapping during PeptideIndexing (e.g., wrong enzyme settings).Will skip this PSM.
Prepared percolator input.
PSM-level FDR: All PSMs are returned by percolator. Reannotating all PSMs in input data with percolator output.
Scores of all other PSMs will be set to 1.0.
593852 suitable PeptideHits of 714457 PSMs were reannotated.
