PSM (PeptideHit) without protein reference found. This may indicate incomplete mapping during PeptideIndexing (e.g., wrong enzyme settings).Will skip this PSM.
Prepared percolator input.
PSM-level FDR: All PSMs are returned by percolator. Reannotating all PSMs in input data with percolator output.
Scores of all other PSMs will be set to 1.0.
