PeptideIndexer found unmatched peptides, which could not be associated to a protein.
Potential solutions:
   - check your FASTA database is identical to the search DB (or use 'auto')
   - set 'enzyme:specificity' and 'enzyme:name' to 'auto' to match the parameters of the search engine
   - increase 'aaa_max' to allow more ambiguous amino acids
   - as a last resort: use the 'unmatched_action' option to accept or even remove unmatched peptides
     (note that unmatched peptides cannot be used for FDR calculation or quantification)
Result files will be written, but PeptideIndexer will exit with an error code.

-----------------------------------
PeptideIndexer found unmatched peptides, which could not be associated to a protein.
Potential solutions:
   - check your FASTA database is identical to the search DB (or use 'auto')
   - set 'enzyme:specificity' and 'enzyme:name' to 'auto' to match the parameters of the search engine
   - increase 'aaa_max' to allow more ambiguous amino acids
   - as a last resort: use the 'unmatched_action' option to accept or even remove unmatched peptides
     (note that unmatched peptides cannot be used for FDR calculation or quantification)
Result files will be written, but PeptideIndexer will exit with an error code.

PeptideIndexer found unmatched peptides, which could not be associated to a protein.
Potential solutions:
   - check your FASTA database is identical to the search DB (or use 'auto')
   - set 'enzyme:specificity' and 'enzyme:name' to 'auto' to match the parameters of the search engine
   - increase 'aaa_max' to allow more ambiguous amino acids
   - as a last resort: use the 'unmatched_action' option to accept or even remove unmatched peptides
     (note that unmatched peptides cannot be used for FDR calculation or quantification)
Result files will be written, but PeptideIndexer will exit with an error code.

   - increase 'aaa_max' to allow more ambiguous amino acids
   - as a last resort: use the 'unmatched_action' option to accept or even remove unmatched peptides
     (note that unmatched peptides cannot be used for FDR calculation or quantification)
Result files will be written, but PeptideIndexer will exit with an error code.
