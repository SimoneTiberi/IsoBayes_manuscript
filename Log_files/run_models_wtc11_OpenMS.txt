We found:
32394 protein isoforms.
Found 24224 correspondances between transcripts and protein isoforms.
The total number of protein isoforms is 32394. For 8170 trascript(s) we set the tpm equal to 0.
If the number of correspondances is relatively high,
	          check if the format name of the protein isoforms is consistent with those of the transcripts.
After FDR filtering (if used), we will analyze:
