AspN
We found:
48382 protein isoforms.
Found 28779
correspondances between transcripts and protein isoforms.
The total number of protein isoforms is 48382.
For 19603 trascript(s) we set the tpm equal to 0.
If the number of correspondances is relatively high,
                check if the format name of the protein isoforms
                is consistent with those of the transcripts.
After FDR filtering (if used), we will analyze:
48382 protein isoforms.
Percentage of unique peptides:
28.35%
